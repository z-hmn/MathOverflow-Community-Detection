# MathOverflow-Community-Detection

This project analyzes interaction data from MathOverflow to identify natural communities of mathematicians. Using Python and network analysis tools, the notebook builds a researcher interaction graph and applies community-detection algorithms to uncover clusters based on shared topics and Q&A relationships.
What’s Included
Graph construction from MathOverflow user interaction data
Network statistics (degree distribution, clustering, centrality)
Community detection using Louvain and other methods
Visualizations of researcher clusters
Tools
Python, Jupyter Notebook, NetworkX, Pandas, Matplotlib

Run:
pip install pandas networkx matplotlib python-louvain
jupyter notebook mathoverflow_community_detection.ipynb
